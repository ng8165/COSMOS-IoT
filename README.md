# COSMOS UC Davis Cluster 8: Internet of Things

This repository contains code for labs/projects done during the COSMOS UC Davis Internet of Things cluster (2022).

In this cluster, we used the TI MSP432 microcontroller board with the EDUMKII Education BoosterPack and the SimpleLink CC3100 WiFi board. We coded in Energia with C/C++ code to create these projects.

To see the final extension project, visit the [MSPRobot repository](https://github.com/ng8165/MSPRobot).
