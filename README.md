# COSMOS UC Davis Cluster 8: Internet of Things

This repository contains code for labs/projects done during the COSMOS UC Davis Internet of Things cluster (2022).

In this cluster, we used the [TI MSP432 microcontroller board](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/MSP-EXP432P401R/5170609) with the [EDUMKII Education BoosterPack](https://www.ti.com/tool/BOOSTXL-EDUMKII) and the [SimpleLink CC3100 WiFi board](https://www.ti.com/product/CC3100). We coded in Energia with C/C++ code to create these projects.

Libraries used:
- [Adafruit MQTT Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library)
- [Energia TI-RSLK Library](https://github.com/fcooper/Energia-RSLK-Library)
- [Energia MQTT PubSub Client](https://github.com/energia/Energia/tree/master/libraries/PubSubClient)

To see the final extension project, visit the [MSPRobot repository](https://github.com/ng8165/MSPRobot).
